<h2>Code Louisville Project - Personal Resume</h2>

This project was completed for the Code Louisville Front-End Development Course. This site is to be used a personal resume for myself, and was built using HTML, CSS, and JS. The features a one completely custom JS function, as well as a couple others inspired and tweaked from a couple of developers I found on CodePen (credited in JS comments).
