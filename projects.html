        <p>I worked with a biomedical servicing company to solve usability issues with their previous website. Though the previous site was operational from a client-side basis, it was a difficult site for the client to manage on their own. The
          desire to improve client usability led to a full site redesign and company rebrand. The previously hard-coded equipment catalog pages were migrated to a Woocommerce catalog, without the ue of hte pricing feature, to easliy allow the client
          to manipulate the main features of their site. In redesigning the site, I also worked with the client to improve the user experience. The company wanted the main function of the website to be the identification of equipment the company
          would repair and the initiation of those repairs. These efforts have led to increased user interaction and greater usage of the online repair system.

        <p>I worked hand-in-hand with the client to design and implement a multi-year website plan to help solve various business problems. I initially designed and developed the site to gather the information of potential workers for each of the company's 9 locations. This iteration of the site gathered over 10,000 applicants in the first year of operation, at which point we turned our attention to attracting companies to come use these workers. The second, and current, iteration of the site has increased the inquiries from potential clients using their staffing service nearly 300%. This satisfaction in the development of the site led the client to utilize other aspects of my company's offerings beyond web development, including email marketing, PPC, and consultation.

        <p>Working with this up-and-coming regional investment real estate company, I pitched and sold them on their first website and initial branding. After settling on a logo design, I worked out the major functions of the website and designed accordingly. This would include developing an easy-to-use custom property catalog for potential buyers, utilizing user permissions to determine property viewing capabilities, and capturing users who wish to sell their homes or rent from the company. Leading this project, I have brought together a team of developers, a marketing specialit, and myself as the lead designer. This project has stretched my management capabilities, as well as increased my interest in skills in custom development beyond the front-end, UI/UX design and development. x
