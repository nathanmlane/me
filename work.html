        <h2>Sidekick</h2>
        <p class="project-specs">Co-Founder | Developer | Project Manager</p>
        <p>Living a dream with a friend. After several years at the same company, an old friend and I got the motivation to
          try out running our own business. At Sidekick, we consider ourselves a full-service microagency, specializing in digital
          marketing and web development. My role in the company is centered on the design and development of our web projects, however
          as with any small business, my hands are in nearly every project and area of responsibility. I am lucky enough to have the
          opportunity to gain more significant experience in financially running a business, being heavily involved in the sales process,
          being heavily involved in the cross-project decision making processes, and cultivating the relationships necessary to allow Sidekick
          to offer our clients an ever-expanding catalog of services. My time running my own endeavor, no matter how long or short, is an
          invaluable experience that few people get to experience and allows me to bring so many more skills and views to the table beyond
          that of an average developer.

        <h2>Freelance</h2>
        <p class="project-specs">Frontend | UI/UX | Project Management</p>
        <p>
          Worked with several agencies and individual clients over the years on projects that were either too small or too large
          for my previous company to take on. These projects varied from singular projects of website management, digital ad creation,
          website design, help managing a project, and the development of both key features and full websites. This experience working with
          projects and teams of all sizes has allowed me to hone my abilities to clearly communicate expectations, follow expectations set
          by others, and to work collaboratively and selflessly to ensure a project can be finished well and on-time.
