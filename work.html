        <p>I love working with a team to create beautiful, functional
          websites, apps, brands, and campaigns. I love the process of learning and growing myself, so that I can improve the quality of the brands, projects, and teams I have the opportunity to work with. As my career continues I hope to continue
          developing into a Full-Stack Developer, who has the opportunity to work closely in design processes, data analysis, and product management.

        <p>Hi, I'm Nate. I am a self-motivated, team-driven, goal-oriented front-end developer and designer. My time in the industry has been marked with continual growth in both the depth and breadth of my skill. Starting with zero experience, I
          worked
          to learn every valuable design, marketing, and development skill I could use to become an invaluable jack-of-all-trades to any and all projects and teams on which I am lucky enough to be included.
