        <p>My role in the company is centered on the design and development of our web projects, however as with any small business, my hands are in nearly every project and area of responsibility. These experiences in financial decision-making,
          developing and executing a sales process, cross-project decision making processes, and the cultivation of relationships have given me invaluable skills that few people get to develop. This allows me to bring many more soft skills to the
          table than an average developer, as well as showcases my desire and ability to continuously learna dn grow in my career.

        <h2>Freelance</h2>
        <p class="project-specs">Front-End | UI/UX | Project Management</p>
        <p>
          Worked with several agencies and individual clients over the years on projects that were either too small or too large
          for my previous company to take on. These projects varied from singular projects of website management, digital ad creation,
          website design, help managing a project, and the development of both key features and full websites. This experience working with
          projects and teams of all sizes has allowed me to hone my abilities to clearly communicate expectations, follow expectations set
          by others, and to work collaboratively and selflessly to ensure a project can be finished well and on-time.
